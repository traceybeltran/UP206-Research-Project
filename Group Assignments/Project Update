Project Update
I realized that my interest in exploring COVID-19 impacts on job loss in Los Angeles County is too ambitious and finding data at the neighborhood level is unrealistic. I decided to broaden my initial research questions and examine possibly job loss at the Los Angeles County level. Iâ€™m interested in seeing poverty trends to determine which neighborhoods might be impacted by job loss. I will look at the following indicators: occupation, income, poverty level, educational attainment, and unemployment rates to help me answer my question. I want to answer the question: Can we pinpoint areas in LA County that will be the most burdened by COVID-19 unemployment or job loss? 

For my final project, I will narrow my focus and look at the increase of Cal Fresh applications and connect with groups like Ground Game LA that provided food locally to look at the neighborhood level poverty.
