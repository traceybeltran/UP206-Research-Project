# UP-206A Research Project: Race and the Economy

## My Research Question
>I'm interested in exploring the impacts COVID-19 has had on jobs in Los Angeles County.  My initial research question is what sectors of employment have been hit hard by COVID-19 and how has this exacerbated poverty in Black and Latinx communities. By looking at poverty, income, and unemployment trends, I will investigate how the COVID-19 closure of businesses further increased unemployment and the potential impacts on families. 

## Why?
>I'm from South Central LA and living in a city and neighborhood at the forefront of gentrification, climate change, and poverty. I'm interested in supporting and developing solutions to the underlining issues that create the problems I've outlined. For me, that includes economic development solutions for folks chronically unemployed or those exposed to barriers is significant for communities like South LA. COVID-19 has had harmful impacts on many organizations and individuals; I think that folks who were living paycheck by paycheck had minimum wage jobs in industries impacted by COVID-19 feel the pandemic's largest brunt there the only source of income was cut off. Many people in South Los Angeles work in the service sector. Therefore, I'm interested to know the impact this can have on members of my community, the long-term effects this can have on the sustainability of South LA. 

## The spatial scope 
>Broadly, I will be looking at Los Angeles County and zooming in on the region of South LA. I define South LA as the areas  South of the ten freeway and North of the 105 freeway, East of La Brea Blvd and West of Central Ave.  I will also look at the surrounding other neighborhoods with similar demographics- Poverty of working-class and poor, Latino and Black residents.

## Potential data sources 

>I will be looking at unemployment rates in LA County, Poverty Rates, and employment sectors. The variables I will include are race, education, income, and occupation. Below are two data sources that I will be using to answer my research question.

>**LA County Open Data: All Jobs 2015**
>https://data.lacounty.gov/Sustainability/All-Jobs-2015/c4jb-i55w

## Methodology
> Looking at census tracts I will be looking at areas in LA county that have high concentrations of unemployment and the occupations. This can also be a view of employment trends in South LA. Maps that show unemployment rates in relation to income, education, gender, and race.

## Conclusion 
>I'm hoping to show the areas hardest hit by increased unemployment rates in Los Angeles and offer possible economic recovery strategies. As the City and County of LA are working towards their budgets for the upcoming fiscal year, it's vital to have data showing areas and people that might need help to support individuals experiencing hardship.
